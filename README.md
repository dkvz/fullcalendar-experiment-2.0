# Fullcalendar Experiments
I concluded I'm going to use the Vue component so this project is sort of abandoned.

## Requirements
Parcel has to be installed globally or the npm scripts won't work:
```
npm install -g parcel-bundler
```

## Importing the lib
I'm following the docs from here: https://fullcalendar.io/docs/initialize-es6

You also need to import the styles. Apparently that caused parcel to automatically add more dependencies.

They also provide their SASS files to include.
